/*
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!

Example :
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6

The guess API is defined in the parent class GuessGame.
@param num, your guess
@return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
int guess(int num);
